1. Bad Search
search engines can be rather literal in the way the search for things. sometimes they will not bring up a relevant page due to phrasing of the search query.

the PDF can be a pain to users as if they don't want to print it or save it, it will slow down the time it takes them to access your material for reading.

3. Not Changing the Color of Visited Links
use good linking conventions. i can be very painful to click a link looking for something to find you have already tried that link. you should always indicate when a link has been used.

straight hard text will scare people away and make them bored. some helpful suggested tips are as follows:

subheads
bulleted lists
highlighted keywords
short paragraphs
the inverted pyramid
a simple writing style

5. Fixed Font Size
let your user resize the font. do not use css rules to fix font size, people sometimes don't like that.

6. Page Titles With Low Search Engine Visibility
be smart in the way you use certain HTML elements so that a search engine is likely to pickup your website for relevant searches

7. Anything That Looks Like an Advertisement
if it looks like an ad it will likely be ignored.

be consistent and try to use conventions in other sites, people like what they know and get annoyed when a site is too different and "foreign"

9. Opening New Browser Windows
if you don't need to cause new windows to pop up, don't. people hate that. they really really hate that.

10. Not Answering Users' Questions
make information easy to attain, if a user wants to knowsomething, make it easy for them to find.
